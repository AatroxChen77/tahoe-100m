# Project Name

## Overview
This project contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks for data preparation, model training, and results visualization. The notebooks are designed to work with the Tahoe-100M dataset, which contains single-cell gene expression data.

## Project Structure

### Notebooks

1. **data_preparation.ipynb**
   - Purpose: Data preprocessing and preparation
   - Main tasks:
     - Import required libraries
     - Load and inspect the data
     - Data cleaning and preprocessing
     - Feature engineering
     - Data validation
     - Save processed data

2. **model_training.ipynb**
   - Purpose: Model development and training
   - Main tasks:
     - Load preprocessed data
     - Model architecture definition
     - Training pipeline implementation
     - Model evaluation
     - Model saving

3. **results_visualization.ipynb**
   - Purpose: Results analysis and visualization
   - Main tasks:
     - Load model results
     - Generate performance metrics
     - Create visualizations
     - Summarize findings

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Required Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start with `data_preparation.ipynb` to preprocess your data
2. Run `model_training.ipynb` to train your models
3. Use `results_visualization.ipynb` to analyze and visualize the results

## Data

The project uses the Tahoe-100M dataset, which contains:
- Single-cell gene expression data
- Drug treatment information
- Cell line metadata
- Sample metadata
